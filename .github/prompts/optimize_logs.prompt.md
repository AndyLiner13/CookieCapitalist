Please remove any excessive logging that isn't immediately applicable or specifically helpful to solving the particular problem that is being addressed at the current moment. There are WAY TOO MANY logs, and it's making it way too difficult for you to identify any individual problem.

You should only add logs for the things you actively need to be addressing. There is way too much redundancy and verbose logging and it's making it almost impossible for you to troubleshoot effectively.

Really narrow down the console logs to diagnose the problem. Be intentional with the logging. You need to log strategically, not excessively or wrecklessly.

And please make sure that you're using the property console_log formatting from the [Console Log Instructions](../instructions/console_log.instructions.md)
